# Personalized Period Tracker with Analytics and Social Sync

This project is a database-driven period tracking system designed to
store, analyze, and generate insights from menstrual health data. It
goes beyond basic date logging by supporting analytics, predictions, and
optional social synchronization with friends.

## Project Overview

The system tracks: - Menstrual cycles and period records - Symptoms with
severity levels - Daily flow logs - Medication usage - Reminders and
predictions - Friend-based cycle overlap (social sync)

The database is designed using EER modeling, implemented in MySQL, and
tested with realistic synthetic data. Basic NoSQL (MongoDB) queries and
Python-based data access and visualization are also included.
